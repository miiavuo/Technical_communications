# What I have learned about technical communication
I've been a technical communicator since forever, it feels now. 
In reality, it's been just about 15 years.
During that time, I've learned that technical communications is sadly so very underrated profession. 
It seems companies believe anyone can do it, or that it does not matter what we put in the user guide or help file, no-one will read it anyway.

Of course, they are wrong.

If their customers are not reading the documentation, it may well indicate that the product is so intuitive, so brilliant, that there is no need for user guidance.
Or it *might* mean that the users **cannot find what they are looking for**, and go for trial and error instead - or send a support request.
